//Arrays - It is a Data stucture which is used to store Data.
     // 1.Array is collection of Homogenous Data of large amount of fixed in size.
     //2. In Array Data is store in the same size of blocks.
     //3. In Array we can store only same type of data.
     //4.Arrays are contijuous in memory And Arrays are linear type of data sturcture.
     //5.each block in array can store a value which is equal to data type of array.
     //6. WHen we need to change something in the Array the we use Array index 
     //7. Array always initilize with 0.
